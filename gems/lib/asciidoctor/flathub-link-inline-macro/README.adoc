= Flathub link inline macro
:toc:


A shorthand for linking applications from link:https://flathub.org[FlatHub].


== Synopsis

[source, asciidoc]
----
flathub:$APP_ID[$CAPTION]
----

Where...

- `$APP_ID` is the application ID of the program on Flathub.

- `$CAPTION` is the link text to be used.
By default, it will get the appstream metadata from FlatHub and use the display name.
Take note it creates an additional network request to get the name.


== Example usage

- `flathub:org.gnome.design.IconLibrary[]` links to the link:https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.design.IconLibrary[FlatHub page of GNOME Icon Library] with `Icon Library` as the link text.

- `flathub:org.gnome.design.IconLibrary[GNOME Icon Library]` is the same as the previous list item but with its link text replaced with `GNOME Icon Library`.
