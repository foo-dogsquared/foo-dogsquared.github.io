= A site overhaul has been occurred

ANNOUNCEMENT: A site overhaul has occurred. Please 
see the changelog. A site overhaul has occurred. 
Please see the changelog.


== From Jekyll to Hugo
First and foremost, the blog has moved from 
https://jekyllrb.com[Jekyll] to https://gohugo.io/[Hugo].
I could create a theme but it would take me way longer 
than should just to migrate the blog so for now I settled 
with the https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-terminal/[Terminal] 
since I'm starting to appreciate terminal-themed websites 
(also, I think it's easier for me to design a terminal-themed website 
if I have to create one).

I've ported the blog to Hugo for multitude of reasons:

* Speed
* Ease of content management
* More organized approach for my content
* Built-in support for blogging with https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] 

Built-in support for https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] although 
it's mostly done through calling external programs.
 
Though Jekyll https://asciidoctor.org/[does have a plug-in for blogging with Asciidoctor],
I don't really want another plug-in for that. I just want a 
static site generator with built-in support for blogging with Asciidoctor and 
Hugo just provides that. The speed and ease of configuration is 
also a really large bonus.


== Change of purpose
The blog is in hiatus due to me taking notes in 
https://www.latex-project.org/[LaTeX] now and a change of 
purpose for my blog. I already have a 
https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/personal-notes/[a storage for my notes]
and
https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/a-remote-repo-full-of-notes-of-things-i-do-not-know-about/[another for my lecture/detailed notes]
so I don't see any point to make this as an all-around notes notebook. 
It's too repetitive to have it around so the vision for my blog 
has changed.

Here's what I think my online notes should be divided with these three 
outlets:

* My notes storage would be short/slightly detailed notes on random things. 
This is basically where my _Simplified!_-type of notes should get in.
* My lecture notes are where detailed studies of subjects or concepts 
should go.
* My blog will be about... I don't know, really. I do have a set of ideas that I 
think it's suitable for blogging about it so let's just find out along the 
way.


== Blog clean-up and revision
Since the overall purpose of the blog has been changed, so does the little 
details that make up the blog.

I've cleaned up my blog by removing most of the posts that I think it's not 
suitable for the blog anymore. The _Learnings and Resources_ series will be reset 
(starting this month) with a couple of revisions and improvement for the reading experience.

The _Simplified!_ series is still going to be up and coming with revisions and a new 
style of technical writing. My https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/personal-notes/[personal notes] 
is still going to have the style of _Simplified!_ series I was originally going for.

I've been thinking about revising my writing style as well. I mostly view my 
current style as too verbose. I've learned that it's became a 
pain to read for my future self if I were to revisit a concept/study again. 

With the revised writing style, I also want to improve my writing by adopting a new 
writing workflow. This is basically the stuff you would encounter in a high school 
writing class but I've been less compliant with it over the last few posts (before the 
change).


== Conclusion
The blog is under change and it's not suitable to be a student's notebook anymore and 
it goes on to my https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/personal-notes/[online] 
https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/a-remote-repo-full-of-notes-of-things-i-do-not-know-about/[notes].

Along with the change of purpose is a change of style and presentation for my 
studies. Starting with the last quarter of the year is taking the more challenging route 
for improvement and hopefully this change reflect that as well.

Well, I still don't know how to end this post so have a nice day! :)
