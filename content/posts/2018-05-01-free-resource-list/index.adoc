= A freebie's resource list (mostly related to programming)

UPDATE: This list is now deprecated. It'll recieve minimal maintenance,
if there's any. Any new updates are now actively developed in my
http://freebies-hunt.netlify.com/[new freebies resource site].
____

This is a free resource list that gradually grew over the past few
months. Admittedly, I don't use all of them so why not just share it,
right?

Just pick a few, don't be overwhelmed by the number of resource you have
to refer to. Focus on one thing at a time. Well, the list is actually
longer but I decided to pick the top contenders of the list (and some of
them are still not being used, I just like to bookmark stuff and never
checking out again sometimes).

Do keep in mind, most of them are related to computer programming but
some of the providers offer stuff outside of programming (say
https://khanacademy.org[Khan Academy] for math).
