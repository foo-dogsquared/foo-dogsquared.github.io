= About the author

Hey there!
I'm Gabriel Arazas but you'll find me as `foodogsquared` on the internet.
I'm just a hobbyist on some things.

I could summarize my list of interests on...

* Creative coding and computational art.
* Free and open source software.
* Linux and whatever shenanigans are in there.
* Software reproducibility which I'm focusing on link:https://nixos.org/[Nix].
* Technical writing.
* Accessible design as I'm trying to find the equilibrium between beautiful and readable design.

There's a lot more but these are the top things right now.
This website is basically just an outlet for those things.
If you want a way to contact me, just drop an email at `hey{at}foodogsquared{dot}one`.
Or you could see link:/contact[my contact page] for more details.
